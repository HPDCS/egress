# Egress model
This is the implementation of the model described in the paper "Agent-based Modeling and Simulation for Emergency Scenarios: A Holistic Approach" (Piccione 2020).

This code runs on [ROOT-Sim](https://github.com/HPDCS/ROOT-Sim), a high-performance discrete event simulator.
The `egress` folder contains the actual model code. For further instructions on how to compile and run the model, please refer to the ROOT-Sim documentation.
The `scripts` folder contains various helper Python scripts which can be used to extract useful data from the simulation runs.
